# Multilayer_Skin_EIT
The project included Teensy board code and robot path planning programming, as well as data collection for three different shapes: circular, rectangular, and irregula.

The project should start with teensy circuit board code, then connecting 16 electrodes, followed by applying external stimuli using a robotic arm. The data collected is inside the data folder.
